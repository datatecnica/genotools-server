## Phase 3: ProcessPool Implementation Strategy

### Component 7A: ProcessPool Parallelization

**Objective**: Replace ThreadPoolExecutor with ProcessPoolExecutor for true parallelism across all 254 genomic files.

### Component 7A: ProcessPool Parallelization âœ… COMPLETED

**Status**: âœ… **IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**

**Key Achievements**:
- **True Parallelization**: Replaced ThreadPoolExecutor with ProcessPoolExecutor for GIL-free execution
- **Process Worker Function**: `extract_single_file_process_worker()` handles process-isolated extraction 
- **Pure ProcessPool Architecture**: Removed ThreadPool fallback, simplified to single execution path
- **Resource Management**: `_calculate_optimal_workers()` prevents system overload
- **Error Isolation**: Failed processes don't crash entire job
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress with tqdm integration
- **Original Allele Fix**: `pgen_a1`/`pgen_a2` now properly populated in variant summaries
- **IMPUTED Support**: Fixed PVAR parsing for VCF-style headers in IMPUTED files
- **Test Suite Cleanup**: Removed obsolete tests, kept 31 passing tests

**Performance Results**:
- **NBA Single File**: 18.5 seconds (ProcessPool) vs 23 seconds (sequential)
- **IMPUTED Files**: Successfully processes VCF-style headers and extracts variants
- **Error Handling**: Robust process failure containment
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient with proper process isolation
- **Test Coverage**: 31 tests passing, zero warnings

**Files Modified**:
- `app/processing/coordinator.py` - Pure ProcessPool implementation, ThreadPool removed
- `app/processing/harmonizer.py` - Fixed PVAR parsing for VCF-style headers
- `app/processing/cache.py` - Updated to use ProcessPool for consistency
- `app/processing/extractor.py` - Removed ThreadPool imports
- `app/models/key_model.py` - Updated to Pydantic v2 ConfigDict
- `app/models/snp_model.py` - Updated to Pydantic v2 ConfigDict
- `tests/` - Removed obsolete test_cache.py and test_multi_allelic.py

**Original Implementation Plan**:

#### 1. Coordinator Architecture Modification
```python
# coordinator.py - Replace ThreadPool with ProcessPool
def execute_harmonized_extraction(self, plan, snp_list_df, parallel=True, max_workers=20):
    # Flatten all files across all data types
    all_tasks = [(file_path, data_type) for data_type, files in data_type_files.items()]
    
    with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers) as executor:
        futures = [
            executor.submit(extract_single_file_standalone, file_path, data_type, 
                          snp_list_ids, snp_list_df, settings)
            for file_path, data_type in all_tasks
        ]
```

#### 2. Standalone Extraction Function
```python  
# New standalone function (not class method) for ProcessPool
def extract_single_file_standalone(file_path, data_type, snp_list_ids, snp_list_df, settings):
    # Create fresh instances in each process
    extractor = VariantExtractor(settings)
    # Perform extraction with process isolation
```

#### 3. Resource Management
- **Process Limits**: Max 20 concurrent processes (prevent resource exhaustion)
- **Batching Strategy**: IMPUTED files processed in batches of 20
- **Memory Isolation**: Each process has dedicated memory space
- **Error Isolation**: Failed processes don't affect others

#### 4. Performance Benefits
- **True CPU Parallelism**: No GIL limitations
- **Process Robustness**: Crashes isolated to individual files
- **Resource Distribution**: Better CPU/memory utilization
- **Scalability**: Full utilization of available cores

### Component 7B: Within-DataType Combination  

**Objective**: Merge ProcessPool results into unified datasets per data type.

**Implementation**:
```python
# Group results by data_type after ProcessPool completion
nba_results = [df for df in all_results if df['data_type'] == 'NBA']
wgs_results = [df for df in all_results if df['data_type'] == 'WGS']  
imputed_results = [df for df in all_results if df['data_type'] == 'IMPUTED']

# Combine within each data type
nba_combined = pd.concat(nba_results, ignore_index=True)
# Generate NBA_combined.parquet, NBA_combined.traw, etc.
```

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Process 1: AAC.pgen extraction (~23s)  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Process 2: EUR.pgen extraction (~23s)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... 9 more ancestries (all parallel)
â”œâ”€â”€ WGS Files (1 process)

    â”œâ”€â”€ Batch 2: Next 20 chromosome files (~2min)
    â””â”€â”€ ... until all 242 files complete

Total Time: ~8 minutes (vs ~45+ minutes sequential)
```

### Combined Output Structure (Phase 3)

IMPUTED_combined.*           # All 242 files (11 ancestries Ã— 22 chromosomes) merged
```

### File Organization (Updated)
```
~/gcs_mounts/genotools_server/precision_med/
â”œâ”€â”€ output/                   # Analysis results (TRAW, Parquet, reports)
â”œâ”€â”€ cache/                    # Available for future caching needs (currently unused)
â””â”€â”€ summary_data/             # SNP lists and reference data
```
